Hi, my nickname on the network is Abanazar.  
  
I am doing Desktop and Backend development.  
Once upon a time programming was my hobby, but now it is my job.  
In my free time from code, I like to read, it doesn't matter an article or a book.  
And I also love coffee and smoke, if you want to propose a meeting, then you know what you need to lure.  

Where to find me?:
